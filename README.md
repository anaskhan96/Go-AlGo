# Go-AlGo

This repository contains the algorithms (implemented in [Go](https://golang.org/)) taught during *Design and Analysis of Algorithms Laboratory* (CS255) course in *PES University*, Bangalore. All files have been grouped according to the week in which they were implemented.

## Testing

Navigate into any particular algorithm's folder and run `go test` command.

Example :
```bash
$ cd Week1/Sequential\ Search
$ go test
```

## Execution

Navigate into any particular algorithm's folder and run `go run file_name.go` command.

Example :
```bash
$ cd Week1/Sequential\ Search
$ go run seqsearch.go
